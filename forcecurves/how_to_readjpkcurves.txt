JPK (out-file) Structure:

HEADER FWD (forward) curve
runs from '#index: ("\d")\r\n' to '#\r\n'
CONTENT FWD curve
runs from '#\r\n' to '\r\n'
HEADER BWD (backward) curve
runs from '#index: ("\d")\r\n' to '#\r\n'
CONTENT BWD curve
runs from '#\r\n' to '\r\n'

from HEADER read (equal for BWD and FWD)
	# sensitivity: ("\d")\r\n
	# springConstant: ("\d")\r\n
from CONTENT read columns 1,2,3,4

multiply column 1 with 'sensitivity' and 'springConstant'
plot the following:
	Vertical Deflection:
		column 1 vs 2 (against sensor)
		column 1 vs 3 (against ramp)
	Horizontal Deflection:
		column 4 vs 2 (against sensor)
		column 4 vs 3 (against ramp)
